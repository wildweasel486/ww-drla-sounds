ww-drla-sounds
==============

Optional sounds patch for Yholl's DoomRL Arsenal mod; I mostly replace sounds that either get boring or don't feel like they match up with the things they belong to.

Instructions!
Download the ZIP from Github (link's up there), or use your Git client of choice to clone it.
Run _zip.bat to create the archive in either pk3 or pk7 format.
If running through ZDL, just make sure ww-drla-sounds is loaded LAST in the list or else not all the replaced sounds will take effect.
If running through the DoomRPG Launcher, you will need to add ww-drla-sounds through the "additional command line options" box, because DoomRPG Launcher will not load the files in the correct order.

Credits within ww-credits.txt (may be out of date). MUST be loaded AFTER DoomRL Arsenal for full effect.

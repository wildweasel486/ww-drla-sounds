Credits for sounds used in this pack and explanations for how I compiled them.

DSSHOTGN - From one of Half-Life 2's grenade explosions and a stock sound effect. I intended to recreate the shotgun sound from STRAIN.wad in higher quality.
DSPISTOL - Mixture of sounds from stock sources.
DSCOMPIS - Mixture of HL2's pistol and Die Hard Trilogy's pistol. Quality sucks but whatever.
DSDEAGLE - Stock sound; you might know it as Goldeneye's Cougar Magnum.
DSSHOT1 - Same as DSSHOTGN without the pumping sound.
DSSGPUMP - Stock sound.
DSSHOTP2 - Same pumping sound as DSSHOTGN.
DSUZIFIR - Alliance of Valiant Arms.
DSUACRIF - ""
DSCHAIN* - Combination of stock gunfire sound plus machinegun firing and mechanical noises from Doom 3.
DSGLKOUT - Combination of reload sounds from System Shock 2 and Return to Castle Wolfenstein.
DSGLKIN - ""
DSGLKCK - Alliance of Valiant Arms.
DSTACSHO - Killing Floor.
DSDBLOAD - ???
DSDBCLS - The Specialists.
DSDBOPN - Quake 3 Arena.
DSPLASMA - ???
DSDSHTGN - 007: Nightfire (PC version); sorry about the low quality but I don't have the original rip anymore.
